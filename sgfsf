    <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
        parents who
        undertook the arduous journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their
        children
        the best future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with
        whatever
        is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the
        fusion
        cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion
        cuisines
        to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>

    <h3>Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small>Chief Food Officer</small></h3>
    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
        colleagues,
        comes from a long established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences
        growing up on
        a farm in the Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources.
        As he
        puts it in his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays,
            pays!</em></p>

        personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread
        the
        tongue lashing that ensues if their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by
        his
        motto, <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em></p>
